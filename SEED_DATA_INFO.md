## üîÑ How Seed Initialization Works

### Automatic Initialization
The `initializeData()` function runs automatically when:
- The app loads for the first time
- localStorage is empty (no existing data)
- It checks for the presence of `bluujobs_users` key

### One-Time Load
```javascript
if (!localStorage.getItem('bluujobs_users')) {
  // Initialize all sample data
}
```
Data is loaded **only once** and persists across page refreshes.

### Data Persistence
All data is stored in browser's localStorage with keys:
- `bluujobs_users` - User accounts
- `bluujobs_jobs` - Job postings
- `bluujobs_applications` - Job applications
- `bluujobs_notifications` - User notifications
- `bluujobs_favorites` - Saved jobs
- `bluujobs_messages` - User messages
- `bluujobs_reviews` - User ratings and reviews
- `bluujobs_current_user` - Active session
